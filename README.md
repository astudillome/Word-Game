# Word-Game
- The game consists of seven tiles that have randomly selected letters (four consonants and three vowels). 

- The user clicks on a tile to use for spelling a word, which populates a field under the available letters tiles.

- There are options for the user while creating the word. The user can undo the last move, clear the word field, reshuffle the provided letters, or enter to submit the word for scoring. There is also a reset button that clears all entries and resets the score.

- For each word that is found the user gets one point per letter, words must be at least four letters long.

- When the enter button is pressed he word s first checked to see if it is on the Words Found list, if it is then an alert stating "Word already found!" issues. is checked against a dictionary database or array. If a match is found a pop alert of "Correct!" is issued. If the word is not found a pop alert of "Word not found, try again!" is issued.

- If the word is in the dictionary then it is  added to the words found list.This will be an unordered list with text decoration removed, no bullets. Score is updated based on the word length.
